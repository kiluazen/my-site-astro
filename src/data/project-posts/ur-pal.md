I would love for someone to know everything about me. So, I can have truthful conversations with them.

For that reason, I decided to build an app that records me all day, transcribes and stores data in text with time stamps.

Based on the context of the conversation it would Retrive relevant info.

Updates:
So far all I can say is I hate android dev, Web dev is so much better.
