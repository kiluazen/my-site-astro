I am building a chatbot that would talk to the user based on the objective it's given and extract as much actionable advice as possible.

As the product gets more users, Product Managers can't talk to all the users to get feedback on their features or get ideas for new ones.

The chat should feel as if you are talking to the PM.

Hit me up if you want to try it out.
