GPT4 Omni

I think this is what must of felt tuning into the Steve jobs launches. So secretive, surprising. When they launched iPhone, iPod, App Store. Suddenly things change because of their presence.

I think OpenAi launches are the Steve jobs launches of my age.

Gpt4o is one such launch.

Faster, Cheaper version of gpt4. With true multi modality.

If you have a small device that has a camera and a microphone. Just give it a 360 camera.

Talk to it, if you are in public text with it etc..

It can take all the three modalities simultaneously, not sure if the latencyof understanding different modalities is the same or not.

So a human has 5 senses.

Eyes, Ears, Nose, Tongue, Skin.

Right now we have eyes, ears added to text format.

Alexa a good format to have ai friend on.

Spectacles is pretty good it has eyes where you have them, and ears where you have them too.

It probably has a bigger field view than you.

Anyway it’s hard for me to kick start a wearable company now. Once you have it. Whether it’s Avi’s Pendant or meta’s Glasses. Or both, one after the other in the timeline.

What products or services are possible that were’t before.

Call a Uber, use gps and decide on the uber. Don’t open app etc..

Privacy is gonna get lower and lower everyday.

If the specs I am wearing right now had eyes and ears, what would I do with it?

When I write code It would look at the code with me, maybe also track my eyes to see where I am looking, but that is same as tracking screen.

The more important thing is the surroundings that it can see.

These are pretty obvious scenarios, But what is possible now and probably will also stay relevant for a year.
