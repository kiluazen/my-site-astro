Over the years in college I have tried to develop habits that last.
One of them was reading some book for an hr everyday before sleep. 
Resisting the temptation to watch some movie or tvshow.

Many of them have fallen apart this year.

To solve this:
There is a positive force you exert for yourself to read a book.
But in order to make the above happen you should also oppose the things that pulling it 180 degrees.
For me, when it's 11 or 12 I have noticed that I say to myself I'm about to sleep now let's check
Instagram. Or let's swipe some bumble etc.
So if I were to make the reading habit I have to make sure I don't open that phone and start wasting time.

Be decisive, you decided you want a laptop. Just buy it don't go back and forth, decide on one and close the deal on that one.

Today's todo:
- [ ] Scan docs, sign the contract and also inform the laptop.
- [ ] Karpathy GPT, code that.
- [ ] Research on some companies.
