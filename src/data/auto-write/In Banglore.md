Now that I am in Banglore and settled down.

It’s time for me to start working on side projects,

That is the only way I can get out of a doom loop.

- Ideas

Voice Cloning, The idea that one can hear a song they like in their friend’s voice.John Landslai, was talking about how many parts of the world has not yet transformed into tech. So finding those things and trying to make something of it is good.

All these ideas are pretty shitty, and are just chasing towards the fancy thing.

Maybe the remedy is to contribute to GitHub repo’s and learn to be productive first.

- Copy Writing

I could work on that, maybe try to copy-write Paul Graham. Because that is the level of clarity you want to emulate. There you go you have enough things to do now.

Seriously thought, You can do a lot of productive things with your time. Read Books, Copy Write, Github, side projects. And you keep crying what shd I do? Allah!!

Why am I thinking of skipping work related stuff to tomorrow, if you have time why don’t you just do it. This is the thing, I feel like I am not paid for the work todayso why bother. You and I know that’s not how you work. Why don’t I feel this urge to explode at work, I should right.

What’s the point of doing multiple things and not being good in any of them.

Just excel in the work and let the world come to you. Maybe as you start working on this deeply you will have an idea that is little away from work, and then you can spend time on that in your personal time.

Great work leads to more great work. You can’t expect to work mediocre in your day job and somehow think you’ll become a gem.

And by the way the current place you are working at is a startup. Indulge in what is happening day to day, have your opinions on how things should have been done.

Look the product idea is decent, so you will learn all the do’s and don’ts of execution because of this right.

What does it mean executing the product, The core of the product is the conversation.

In other words it’s the prompting, What else can be done to improve the conversation.

Anyway if the prompt is the key. So much of prompt development is not known. How do you know if particular part in the prompt is making the LLM confused on what to do.

Are there contradictions in the prompt.

Most importantly if I do change a prompt how can I know if it has enhanced the conversation in a direction I wanted (not some subjective bullshit).

Try to draw a ven diagram of the prompt and see if there are places of contradiction.

One thing I was advised to do was to prepare a gold dataset, and learn about how the MMLU benchmarks are created. So let’s think about how this can be helpful to do.

Why are we preparing a gold dataset.

- You can retrieve some good examples for the LLM to replicate in a certain situation.

- One way to evaluate LLM would be to see if in a crucial topic change picked from the golden dataset, if it’s performing well. More technically we will see how much of the response is similar to the one in the golden dataset.
