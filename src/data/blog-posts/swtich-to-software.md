description: Explanation for a recurring question

I been asked this question by many people. I don't see this as one path left for another.

There are interweaving aspects to it, and I hope to do that.

I find coding more fun, and you can get a lot done by just having a laptop and internet.

As naval said the margin for entry is very low. And every time I talk to someone in Aerospace, they say to do anything significant you are demanded a Master, phd etc.. Which I am not sure I wanna get. I am to eager to start building stuff. I am very enthusiastic about startups, I would like to join one or start my own. 

As a physics lover I find SpaceCrafts very compelling, The idea of exploring the stars has always fascinated me which actually was the reason to take Aerospace in the first place.

I still want to continue and learn about AeroSpace in my own time, this decade would have great things with AI and I am all in on that.

WIP: I will update this as I put more of my thoughts together.
