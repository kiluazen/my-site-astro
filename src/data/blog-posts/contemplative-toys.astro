        <p>Calabi-Yau Manifoldse</p>
      </div>

      <p class="pt-2">These are complex geometric shapes that play a crucial role in string theory. They're thought to represent the extra dimensions of our universe that we can't directly observe.</p>
      <p class="pt-2">In string theory, these manifolds are used to "compactify" the extra dimensions required by the theory, potentially explaining why we only perceive four spacetime dimensions in our everyday lives.</p>

      <p class="pt-4">Why it's cooler than a superconductor at absolute zero:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>- It's a 3D representation of a 6D shape. Take that, tesseract!</li>

        <li>- You can casually say ‚ÄúOh, that's just a visual representation of the hidden dimensions of our universe" to drop some fizz</li>
          
        <li>- Understanding it might qualify you for a cameo in the next "Ant-Man" movie.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="pt-4 font-semibold">You should have own these because</p>
      <p>Imagine holding this and contemplating about the universe, reminds of that Oppenheimer scene.</p>

      <p class="pt-2">It's a mind-bending demonstration of how straight lines can create curved surfaces.</p>
      <p class="pt-2">A hyperboloid is generated by rotating a hyperbola around one of its axes. The cool part? It can be constructed entirely from straight lines!
      </p>

      <p class="pt-4">Why it's cooler than liquid nitrogen:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>- It's the secret behind some of the world's most stunning cooling towers and buildings</li>

        <li>- Spin it and watch your friends go cross-eyed trying to follow the lines
        </li>
          
        <li>- It's living proof that even in geometry, the shortest distance between two points can be a curvy line</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="pt-4 ">The science bit: Hyperboloid structures are incredibly strong and stable, which is why they're used in architecture. The straight lines that form the curved surface distribute forces efficiently, making them ideal for tall structures.</p>
      <p>Take Away: Great things are built by being straight, unless she is bi then go have a threesome.</p>

      <p>Remember that scene in "Inception" where the stairs keep going?. It's the "I'm not drunk bro the laws of physics are" of shapes.</p>
      <p class="pt-4">Why it's cooler than absolute zero:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>- It Makes you feel as if you found a glitch in the Matrix.</li>

        <li>- You can stare at it for hours and contemplate on ‚ÄòWhat does this mean for our universe that this shape exists‚Äô‚Äì perfect for procrastination!
        </li>
          
        <li>- It‚Äôs a shape that will have you question reality.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="pt-4 font-semibold">You should have own these because</p>
      <p>It challenges our brain's ability to interpret 2D representations of 3D objects, revealing fascinating insights about visual perception and spatial reasoning.</p>

        <p>Interlocking Helical Cones</p>
      </div>

      <p>Picture this: DNA decided to quit biology and pursue a career in modern art. The result? Interlocking helical cones. It's like watching two tornadoes slow dancing.</p>
      <p class="pt-4">Why it's cooler than Bose-Einstein condensate:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>- It's hypnotic to watch, Perfect demonstration of helical symmetry</li>

          <li>- Makes you appreciate why nature chose the double helix for DNA.</li>
          
          <li>- Starting at it will make you contemplate about all the places that you see helix in your life. Appreciate them better</li>

        
      </ul>
      <p class="pt-2">Fun fact: This shape is a key player in screw theory. Yes, that's a real branch of mathematics, and no, it's not what you think it is.</p>
      <p class="pt-4 font-semibold">Why you should have one of these</p>
      <p>Helical structures are ubiquitous in nature, from DNA to plant tendrils. This model helps visualize complex helical geometries, which have applications in fields ranging from biology to mechanical engineering.</p>

      <p class="pt-2">it doesn't look as cool as the others. But remember, beauty is on the inside. This shape has character!</p>
      <p>Let's Learn about it‚Äôs character:</p>
      <p class="pt-4">Why it's cooler than quantum tunnelling:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>- It‚Äôs your answer for "Other than a circle, what shape can a manhole cover be made so that it cannot fall down through the hole?‚Äù</li>

          <li>- - It's the geometric rebel ‚Äì constant width without conforming to circular norms üòâ</li> 
      </ul>
      <p class="pt-2">Curves of constant width have fascinating properties and practical applications. They're used in everything from cam mechanisms in engines to coin designs. The Reuleaux triangle demonstrates that circular motion doesn't necessarily require a circular shape!</p>
