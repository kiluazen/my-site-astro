    <p>These are complex geometric shapes that play a crucial role in string theory. They're thought to represent the extra dimensions of our universe that we can't directly observe.</p>
    <p class="pt-2">In string theory, these manifolds are used to "compactify" the extra dimensions required by the theory, potentially explaining why we only perceive four spacetime dimensions in our everyday lives.</p>

    <p class="pt-4">Why it's cooler than a superconductor at absolute zero:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>- It's a 3D representation of a 6D shape. Take that, tesseract!</li>

      <li>- You can casually say â€œOh, that's just a visual representation of the hidden dimensions of our universe" to drop some fizz</li>
        
      <li>- Understanding it might qualify you for a cameo in the next "Ant-Man" movie.</li>
    </ul>
