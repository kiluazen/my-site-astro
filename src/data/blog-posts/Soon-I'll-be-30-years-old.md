description: Thinking about my next 10 years.
---

This title is from the '7 Years' song by Lukas Graham. I was listening to it the other day and decided to write this. I am about to graduate in a month, ( 21 years old as of 2024 ).

This writing would be a great exercise to think about the future and in which directions I want to evolve. It's going to be a crazy decade, I want to make a contribution that would generate wealth and also capture it, making me free of financial constraints in life.

I was listening to the [Farza Majeed](https://www.linkedin.com/in/farza-majeed-76685612a/overlay/about-this-profile/) the founder of buildspace talking about his journey. Learning about people who built great products, it's clear to me that they built many side projects. Out of which one of them took off, giving them some success/revenue. At every stage, they up their game, and also get better at picking ideas.

The Lady in the John Wick movie [Rina Sawayama](https://www.google.com/search?q=Rina+Sawayama&sca_esv=2465539c7fa84006&biw=1536&bih=752&sxsrf=ACQVn0-nZtAc0CwprvX-Xs9yqHvrm-zBNw%3A1712777786485&ei=OuoWZs-jHfKo1e8Pw_yKgAQ&ved=0ahUKEwjPqKu8sriFAxVyVPUHHUO-AkAQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=Rina+Sawayama&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiDVJpbmEgU2F3YXlhbWEyBBAjGCcyBBAjGCcyChAjGIAEGIoFGCcyERAuGIMBGJECGLEDGIAEGIoFMgoQABiABBiKBRhDMgsQLhiABBiKBRiRAjIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgARIuQdQ4QJYmwRwAXgBkAEAmAHGAaAB2QKqAQMwLjK4AQPIAQD4AQGYAgKgArMBwgIKEAAYRxjWBBiwA5gDAIgGAZAGCJIHAzEuMaAHrx8&sclient=gws-wiz-serp#ip=1), is a singer who wants to be an actor.
When she was asked how she got cast (Video Timestamp: [3.50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQbDUisfQ2k&ab_channel=BBCRadio1) ), she said "I always treated my music videos as my acting portfolio, So I'd write characters and play them", Chad the director saw her videos and noticed her doing some fight moves in one of the videosc and reached out, She screams "it worked!" in the interview.  

That's how I am gonna treat my side projects and the writing. They are a portfolio, it's me showing the world what I have done and what I am capable of.

I feel ashamed hearing people talk about them working on side projects at 14.., being in my final year I haven't worked on many side projects, and the few I have started I haven't finished. I started programming in my second year. Right now I am working on a tool that would help you write better coldEmails, I want to get this shipped. I realize the importance of finishing things.

IN 10 years.
Hopefully, by working on these side projects and putting myself out there with writing, I will find a hard problem to work on that would generate a lot of wealth, In other words in 10 years I want to already working on a startup for at least 6 years.

IN 5 years.
I really wish to be in San Francisco, but I don't see a plausible way other than doing MS. Which would put me in a lot of debt, Debt is okay if I work for a big tech for some years but I wanna start my own thing. Hopefully, at least I'll visit and be inspired by the Aura of Silicon Valley.

IN 2 years.
This is interesting, in 2 years is much more of a defined problem for me. And every active decision I make will influence that.
Along with my job, I want to as I said work on side projects. Brainstorming project ideas has been hard, hearing my ColdEmail idea must have outed that earlier. Hopefully, I'll get better at it and have some significant creations.

I want to take my writing seriously. One thing I know is: that I love writing, the feeling I get when I write is like a flow of state where I am talking to myself with my mouth shut and all along just writing it. I love writing on paper. But procrastination and other obligations have taken this out and I am not letting them anymore.
Be disciplined and put something out every week, similar to how you disciplined yourself into working out every day.

Speaking of the gym, I wish to be in good shape by next year this time. scratch that I expect to be ...
I've been going to the gym for the past 1.5 years, with a couple of months of exception in between. The effectiveness has been an e^x so far, i.e. last month was the most effective I have ever been, I understand what to do and how more. If that trend continues, This is a highly probable outcome. My life has changed significantly since the last 1 year of gym, lost some weight, got me out of a low period in my life, made me feel better about myself, etc.

I also want to date, I have a lot to learn from dating. I had my first  xxxxxxship that lasted a couple months with Bandana. She told me I was insensitive after breaking up. I realize that I was trying to be a stoic and carefree guy which actually came off as insensitive and non empathetic which I don't think I am. I know in the back of my head like be yourself etc. But somehow I faked some aspects which I didn't realize at the time. Learn to be more open, and allow myself to be vulnerable in front of the person. 

When we used to discuss typical Indian problems with parents. I used to dismiss them which were related to communication and obligations to parents, the guarantee that her parents are gonna marry her off by 26. But in honesty, these are the problems I'll face too, for some reason, I behaved as if I am above them. Once my mother was talking about how she would get me married by this age, I got so frustrated cause it angers me to think someone was making my decisions. 
I wish I said this to her, I will write a letter apologizing for this.

With all this aside, one of my great ambitions is to start a company. What better way to get rich and create value right!!

I hope one of my side projects will lead me to this, or the people I'll meet in Bengaluru will lead me to this. From my side, I want my writing, side projects, and my physical presence in Bengaluru to give me enough surface area to be exposed for luck.

Overall very optimistic about what's about to come. Hopefully, I stay productive and enjoy the process.

Peace!!
